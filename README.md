# ðŸ›’ Project #1 : E-Commerce Data Analysis using Pandas & Plotly
This Python project focuses on analyzing e-commerce transaction data to uncover valuable business insights. It uses Pandas for data wrangling and Plotly for interactive visualizations. The goal is to help e-commerce platforms make data-driven decisions around product performance, sales trends, and customer behavior.

# Libraries Used:
--Pandas â€“ Data loading, cleaning, transformation, grouping.

--Plotly Express â€“ Interactive visualizations (e.g., bar charts).

--Plotly Graph Objects â€“ Advanced and styled plots.

--Plotly I/O and Colors â€“ Custom templates and themes.

--Matplotlib â€“ Static plots (imported but not emphasized).

--Seaborn â€“ For statistical plotting (imported).

--Datetime â€“ Time feature extraction from date columns.

# Key Features:
---Loaded and cleaned raw e-commerce transaction data using Pandas

---Extracted date-based features like Month, Day, and Year from Order Date

---Performed feature engineering (e.g., Profit Margin, Days to Ship)

---Grouped data to analyze:
   -Sales by Segment, Category, and Sub-Category.
   -Monthly revenue and seasonal peaks.
   -Regional trends using State and City.
   -Applied advanced grouping, filtering, and sorting for insights.
   -Created interactive charts to showcase findings.

 # Objective:
--The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize e-commerce sales data to identify key patterns in customer purchases, revenue trends, product categories, and time-based performance. By using interactive visualizations and advanced data grouping, this project helps stakeholders:

--Understand monthly and seasonal sales performance.

--Identify top-selling products and categories.

--Monitor state-wise and city-wise order trends.

--Analyze profitability and discount impact.

--Explore customer segments and their behavior.
